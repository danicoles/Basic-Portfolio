		<h1>About Me</h1>

		<img src="./assets/images/newt7.jpg" id="img1" height="150px">

		<p>I have been interested in coding for a while now and was very excited to find and be accepted to the Extension program through UCSD for Full Stack Web Design. I know this will make many positive changes in my life and I am excited to learn as much as possible. </p>

		<p>In my free time, I enjoy many outdoor activities. My favorite is bicycle-camping. It is similar to backpacking, but instead of carrying your camping gear on your back, you load it all onto your bike. I have done many two and three days trips in various parts along the Southern Coast of California, and Joshua Tree. I always bring my dog on the trips. He really enjoys camping, and we have a few other bicycle dogs in our group. Next year I hope to do an eight day ride along the Great Allegheny Pass and the C&O Towpath in the Eastern US. That will be my longest ride to date.</p>
